## Student Do: Security Culture Framework Part 2

### Instructions

Welcome back!

In this exercise, you'll complete the action plan that you began drafting for your client in the first exercise.

Your plan will need to specify the following details:

1. **Involve the Right People**:: Identify the teams and/or managers involved, and explain how the security department should collaborate with them.

    - HR
    - Physical Security Team (Security Guards)
    - Account (if we need to buy things) - IT Controller or Procurement Team
    - Corporate Communications (who is informing people of the changes)
    - IT Team (For Logs or servers etc)
    - Maintenance (Building Manager)
    - Contractor for any work that needs to be done

2. **Make an Action Plan**: Identify your "plan of attack". For example, you might propose to run a training; implement stricter security controls; some combination of the two; etc.
    - Training
    - Turnstyle
    - Badge Readers

3. **Schedule**: Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.
