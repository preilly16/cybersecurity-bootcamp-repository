### IMPORTANT:

* Next week, you and students will start using Azure Labs to access the lab environments that will be used in class. 

* At the end of the last class this week, you will demonstrate how to access Azure and the specific Terminal/Linux lab environment. Please prep for this before class, and make sure that you have the appropriate lab registration link as well as credentials to access Azure and the lab environment. 

* You will also receive a spreadsheet with access credentials for your students. Each student will have unique credentials, and ONLY distribute these credentials after you have done the demonstration with students. 

* Inform students that there will be mandatory office hours following class on 2.3 and before class on 3.1. The time will be used to make sure everyone has been set up on Azure and has access to the lab environment 

* Note that certain future units will require that you and students have access to new and different lab environments. You will receive registration links to these lab environments prior to these weeks which, when clicked, will have the new environments automatically appear in your Azure labs dashboard
