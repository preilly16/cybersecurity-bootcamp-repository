#Create a tar file
tar cvf <filename of tar to be created> <filepath of data to be added to tar file>
-- If we want to verify all data was properly added to tar file:
-- tar Wcvf <filename of existing tar file> <filepath of data to be added to tar file>

#List the contents of a tar file
tar tvf <filename of existing tar file>

#Extract data from a tar file to a specific directory
tar xvf <filename of existing tar file> -C <filepath of where you want the data to go>
