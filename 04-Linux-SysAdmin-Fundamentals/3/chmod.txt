How Special Permissions Apply to things

IF Sticky Bit is set to Directory
THEN Only Owner or Root can delete

IF SUID is set to a Directory
THEN Files created in that directory get the same Owner that the Directory has

IF GUID is set to a Directory
THEN Files created in that directory get the same Group that the Directory has


IF Sticky Bit is set to a File
THEN Only Owner or Root can delete

IF SUID is set to a File 
THEN that file 'runs with the permissions of' the Owner associated with the file

IF GUID is set to a File 
THEN that file 'runs with the permissions of' the Group associated with the file



Find Files with SUID set
find -type f -perm -u+s
