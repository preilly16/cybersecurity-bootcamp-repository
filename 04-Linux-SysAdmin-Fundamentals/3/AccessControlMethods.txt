Discretionary Access Control
# You get to decide the permissions(rules) for your own items


Mandatory Access Control
# System Owner Assigns Permissions, everyone has to follow them
# Someone else set the rules, you have to follow them


Role Based Access Control
# Similar to Mandatory Access Control BUT rules are assigned to you based on
# your *role* (could be job title, could be department, etc)
- On a single system, different users have different rules because of their title


Attribute Based Access Control
#Similar to role based access control
#We're going to ask a series of questions to the *subject*
#Decide what rules they have to follow based on the responses to the question.
#Example:
#IF subject's role is manager THEN give them admin access
#UNLESS subject's machine does not have anti-virus installed
